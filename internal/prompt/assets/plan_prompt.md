0a. Study `specs/*` with up to 20 parallel Sonnet subagents to learn the application specifications.
0b. Study @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md (if present) to understand the plan so far.
0c. Study `src/lib/*` with up to 20 parallel Sonnet subagents to understand shared utilities & components.
0d. For reference, the application source code is in `src/*`.

1. Study @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md (if present; it may be incorrect) and use up to 20 Sonnet subagents to study existing source code in `src/*` and compare it against `specs/*`. Use an Opus subagent to analyze findings, prioritize tasks, and create/update @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md as a bullet point list sorted in priority of items yet to be implemented. Consider searching for TODO, minimal implementations, placeholders, skipped/flaky tests, and inconsistent patterns. Study @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md to determine starting point for research and keep it up to date with items considered complete/incomplete using subagents.

IMPORTANT: You have a maximum of 15 minutes per planning iteration. Focus on the highest-impact findings first and wrap up within this time constraint. It is better to produce a solid, partial plan than to exhaustively analyze everything.

IMPORTANT: Plan only. Do NOT implement anything. Do NOT assume functionality is missing; confirm with code search first. Treat `src/lib` as the project's standard library for shared utilities and components. Prefer consolidated, idiomatic implementations there over ad-hoc copies.

ULTIMATE GOAL: $ultimate_goal_placeholder_sentence. Consider missing elements and plan accordingly. If an element is missing, search first to confirm it doesn't exist, then if needed author the specification at specs/FILENAME.md. If you create a new element then document the plan to implement it in @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md using a subagent.

99. Never restore a deleted IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md, nor recover from git history. That was intentionally deleted by a human.
999. Exit when you've created the IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md with all the updates. Another agent is tasked with implementing it, not you. Don't implement anything.
